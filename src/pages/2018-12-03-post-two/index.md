E-cigarettes are electronic devices that heat a liquid and produce an aerosol, or mix of small particles in the air.
E-cigarettes come in many shapes and sizes. Most have a battery, a heating element, and a place to hold a liquid.
Some e-cigarettes look like regular cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. Some look like USB flash drives, pens, and other everyday items. Larger devices such as tank systems, or “mods,” do not look like other tobacco products.
E-cigarettes are known by many different names. They are sometimes called “e-cigs,” “e-hookahs,” “mods,” “vape pens,” “vapes,” “tank systems,” and “electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).”
Using an e-cigarette is sometimes called “vaping” or “JUULing.”
