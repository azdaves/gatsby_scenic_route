**Howdy!** 

After building a few lame React apps, and going through several React tutorials I stumbled upon a book by Robin Wieruch: the Road to learn React. I’m pretty excited to plow through this book as it looks like Robin is dedicated to keep this consistently updated and has a Slack community built around it. Robin has a challenge at the start of his book so I took up the challenge. Here is my blog detailing 

My roadmap from Cop to Code

The Clear Path

HTML, CSS, JS, Responsive Web Design, Sass, Bootstrap, Webpack, Modular JS, React, Redux, Testing, Projects and more 


The Actual Path
HTML, some Python, a little JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, React, some tutorial projects, more React, (OK let’s learn JS for real this time), some JS projects, more React, books in JS, books in React, some Webpack, MySQL, React projects (now we’re having some fun), build some React projects on my own, dig deep into JS, continue the journey ….
